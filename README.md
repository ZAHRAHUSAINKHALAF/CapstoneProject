# Under the Hood: Analyzing Germany’s Used Car Trends!
## INTRODUCTION
With the rising demand for affordable and diverse vehicle options, used cars have become an attractive choice for buyers. As a consulting firm specializing in the used car market, we analyzed eBay’s used car listings to identify key trends and provide data-driven insights. This analysis aims to support smarter decisions for both everyday customers and automotive investors.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To recommend the most valuable used car options to our customers, we need to conduct a comprehensive comparison across the entire German eBay used car marketplace. Our goal is to answer key questions such as: What is a fair price range for different vehicle types? Which brands offer the best reliability, and which ones should be approached with caution? And ultimately, what kinds of cars demonstrate the highest durability over time?

## OBJECTIVES
	Compare car prices by year, type, and condition.
	Identify brands with extreme prices and damage rates.
	Explore how mileage affects damage and price.
	Analyze brand availability and their condition.
	Assess listing speed and vehicle age trends.

## TARGET AUDIENCE
	Costumers looking to buy used cars.
	Automotive Investors.
## DATASET
The analysis utilizes the autos.csv dataset, a comprehensive web-scraped collection from the German eBay Kleinanzeigen marketplace. This dataset contains approximately 370,000 rows and 20 columns, offering rich insights into the used car market in Germany. Each entry represents a single vehicle advertisement and includes detailed features about the vehicle’s condition, pricing, listing behavior, and seller characteristics.
