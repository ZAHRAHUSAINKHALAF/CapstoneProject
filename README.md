# Under the Hood: Analyzing Germanyâ€™s Used Car Trends!
## INTRODUCTION
With the rising demand for affordable and diverse vehicle options, used cars have become an attractive choice for buyers. As a consulting firm specializing in the used car market, we analyzed eBayâ€™s used car listings to identify key trends and provide data-driven insights. This analysis aims to support smarter decisions for both everyday customers and automotive investors.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To recommend the most valuable used car options to our customers, we need to conduct a comprehensive comparison across the entire German eBay used car marketplace. Our goal is to answer key questions such as: What is a fair price range for different vehicle types? Which brands offer the best reliability, and which ones should be approached with caution? And ultimately, what kinds of cars demonstrate the highest durability over time?

## OBJECTIVES
ðŸš™	Compare car prices by year, type, and condition.

ðŸš™	Identify brands with extreme prices and damage rates.

ðŸš™ Explore how mileage affects damage and price.

ðŸš™	Analyze brand availability and their condition.

ðŸš™	Assess listing speed and vehicle age trends.

## TARGET AUDIENCE
ðŸš™ Costumers looking to buy used cars.

ðŸš™	Automotive Investors.

## DATASET
The analysis utilizes the autos.csv dataset, a comprehensive web-scraped collection from the German eBay Kleinanzeigen marketplace. This dataset contains approximately 370,000 rows and 20 columns, offering rich insights into the used car market in Germany. Each entry represents a single vehicle advertisement and includes detailed features about the vehicleâ€™s condition, pricing, listing behavior, and seller characteristics.

While the original dataset is widely referenced in data science practice projects (such as on Kaggle or Dataquest), you may find similar versions through open-source platforms. If you'd like, I can help you locate a publicly available version.

## DATA HANDLING
began by inspecting the dataset for inconsistent or misplaced values across all columns. Based on this initial assessment I deleted some rows and also I removed certain columns that offered limited analytical value. These included:

ðŸš™ **seller and offerType** : as they contained only one unique value and lacked variability

ðŸš™ **abtest**: since its purpose remained unclear even after reviewing the data dictionary

To enhance the datasetâ€™s analytical depth, I introduced two new columns:

ðŸš™ **Timeframe** : the number of days between when the ad was created and when it was last seen online

ðŸš™ **carAge** : the difference between the year the crawling was conducted and the carâ€™s registration year

I also developed additional measures to support deeper insights:

ðŸš™ **DamageRate** : the proportion of vehicles with unrepaired damage, calculated per brand

ðŸš™ **MedianPrice** : the median listing price for the vehicles

Data cleaning steps included standardizing inconsistent value names and filtering the dataset to retain only reasonably qualified car listings. Specifically, I limited:

ðŸš™ **yearOfRegistration to the range 1950â€“2016**

ðŸš™ **powerPS to 30â€“500 horsepower**

ðŸš™ **price to between â‚¬100 and â‚¬100,000**
