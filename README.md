# Under the Hood: Analyzing Germanyâ€™s Used Car Trends!
## INTRODUCTION
With the rising demand for affordable and diverse vehicle options, used cars have become an attractive choice for buyers. As a consulting firm specializing in the used car market, we analyzed eBayâ€™s used car listings to identify key trends and provide data-driven insights. This analysis aims to support smarter decisions for both everyday customers and automotive investors.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To recommend the most valuable used car options to our customers, we need to conduct a comprehensive comparison across the entire German eBay used car marketplace. Our goal is to answer key questions such as: What is a fair price range for different vehicle types? Which brands offer the best reliability, and which ones should be approached with caution? And ultimately, what kinds of cars demonstrate the highest durability over time?

## OBJECTIVES
ðŸš™	Compare car prices by year, type, and condition.

ðŸš™	Identify brands with extreme prices and damage rates.

ðŸš™ Explore how mileage affects damage and price.

ðŸš™	Analyze brand availability and their condition.

ðŸš™	Assess listing speed and vehicle age trends.

## TARGET AUDIENCE
ðŸš™ Costumers looking to buy used cars.

ðŸš™	Automotive Investors.

## DATASET
The analysis utilizes the autos.csv dataset, a comprehensive web-scraped collection from the German eBay Kleinanzeigen marketplace. This dataset contains approximately 370,000 rows and 20 columns, offering rich insights into the used car market in Germany. Each entry represents a single vehicle advertisement and includes detailed features about the vehicleâ€™s condition, pricing, listing behavior, and seller characteristics.

## DATA HANDLING
began by inspecting the dataset for inconsistent or misplaced values across all columns. Based on this initial assessment I deleted some rows and also I removed certain columns that offered limited analytical value. These included:

ðŸš™ **seller and offerType** : as they contained only one unique value and lacked variability

ðŸš™ **abtest**: since its purpose remained unclear even after reviewing the data dictionary

To enhance the datasetâ€™s analytical depth, I introduced two new columns:

ðŸš™ **Timeframe** : the number of days between when the ad was created and when it was last seen online

ðŸš™ **carAge** : the difference between the year the crawling was conducted and the carâ€™s registration year

I also developed additional measures to support deeper insights:

ðŸš™ **DamageRate** : the proportion of vehicles with unrepaired damage, calculated per brand

ðŸš™ **MedianPrice** : the median listing price for the vehicles

Data cleaning steps included standardizing inconsistent value names and filtering the dataset to retain only reasonably qualified car listings. Specifically, I limited:

ðŸš™ **yearOfRegistration to the range 1950â€“2016**

ðŸš™ **powerPS to 30â€“500 horsepower**

ðŸš™ **price to between â‚¬100 and â‚¬100,000**

## MAIN ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
![1](images/1.png)

Between 1950 and 1990, car prices fluctuated significantly, largely due to the presence of rare or discontinued models that commanded higher values. From 1995 to 2010, there was a noticeable decline in median prices, coinciding with a surge in the number of vehicles entering the market. However, between 2010 and 2016, median prices began to rise again, possibly reflecting shifts in consumer demand, newer models, or improved vehicle features.

![2](images/2.png)

At first glance, cars with lower mileage appeared to have surprisingly lower prices, which seemed counterintuitive. However, after analyzing the damage rate, I found that these vehicles had a significantly higher proportion of unrepaired damage, offering a likely explanation for the reduced prices.

![4](images/4.png)

The first graph highlights the car brands with the highest median prices, most of which are well-known and reputable manufacturers. In contrast, the brands with the lowest median prices tend to be less common and less recognizable in the market.

![5](images/5.png)

There is a clear inverse relationship between damage rate and median price across car brands. As the proportion of unrepaired vehicles within a brand decreases, the median price of that brand tends to rise. This suggests that buyers place significant value on vehicle condition and are willing to pay more for brands with a lower incidence of damage.

This section presents an overview of car brands and their respective models that exhibit the lowest rates of unrepaired damage. These brands demonstrate higher vehicle condition standards, which may contribute to stronger buyer confidence and potentially higher market value.

This graph compares the average car age and listing duration based on whether the vehicle has unrepaired damage, revealing that older, damaged cars tend to stay online for a shorter time.

![8](images/8.png)

This chart illustrates the relationship between car age and damage rate, with a noticeable peak occurring around vehicles that are 20 years old.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

ðŸš™ Avoid buying vehicles with mileage under 5,000 km. 

ðŸš™ higher listing counts typically corresponds to lower vehicle prices.

ðŸš™ Choose Brands with lower damage rate and reasonable prices.

ðŸš™ Avoid cars around 20 years old, as they are more likely to have damage.



## LIMITATIONS 
Accurate vehicle pricing requires localized, region-specific data. Bahrain-specific datasets provide more relevant insights for understanding the local used car market. However, fields like dateCreated and lastSeen in the current dataset complicate time-based analysis, as they reflect user-driven updates rather than consistent tracking. Additionally, the entire data collection window spans only two months, which limits the potential for long-term trend analysis.
